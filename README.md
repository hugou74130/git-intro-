## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

This "Git Intro" repository is a dedicated, hands-on learning resource created specifically for beginners who are taking their first steps with Git and GitHub. The primary purpose of this project is to demystify version control, transitioning you from confusion to confidence by providing a safe, controlled environment for practice. We focus on the absolute essentials, ensuring you grasp the core concepts and master fundamental commands like clone, add, commit, push, and pull without the pressure of a complex, live production project.

The ultimate goal is to equip you with the practical knowledge necessary to collaborate effectively and manage your own code history. By providing clear, step-by-step exercises and files explicitly designed for experimentation, this project ensures you can gain true mastery over the basic Git workflow. Use this space to make mistakes, learn from them, and firmly establish the foundational skills required before moving on to larger, team-based development projects.
### Prerequisites

To get started with this project and practice the Git commands, you primarily need two things installed on your system: Git and a Code Editor.

1. Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

    Git: The version control system itself.

    A Code Editor: To view and modify the files within the repository (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom).

    A Command Line Interface (CLI): You will be executing all Git commands through a terminal window (e.g., Terminal on Mac/Linux, Git Bash on Windows, or integrated terminal in your code editor).

2. Installation Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

### Installing

This section provides a step-by-step guide to get your Git development environment running and ready for practice.

Step 1: Install Git

The first step is installing the Git version control system on your computer.
Bash

# On Windows, download and run the installer from git-scm.com.
# On macOS (using Homebrew):
brew install git

# On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git

Step 2: Verify Git Installation

Confirm that Git is installed correctly and accessible from your command line.
Bash

# Check the installed version of Git
git --version

Step 3: Configure Your Git Identity

Set your global user name and email. These credentials will be attached to every commit you make.
Bash

# Replace "Your Name" with your actual name
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Replace "your.email@example.com" with your actual email
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

Step 4: Clone the Git Intro Repository

Download a copy of this entire project repository onto your local machine.
Bash

# Navigate to the folder where you want to keep your projects
cd ~/Projects

# Clone the repository (Replace [REPOSITORY_URL] with the actual URL)
git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]

Step 5: Navigate into the Project Directory

Change your current directory in the terminal to the newly cloned project folder.
Bash

# Change directory into the cloned project folder
cd git-intro
