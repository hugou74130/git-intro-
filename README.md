## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

This "Git Intro" repository is a dedicated, hands-on learning resource created specifically for beginners who are taking their first steps with Git and GitHub. The primary purpose of this project is to demystify version control, transitioning you from confusion to confidence by providing a safe, controlled environment for practice. We focus on the absolute essentials, ensuring you grasp the core concepts and master fundamental commands like clone, add, commit, push, and pull without the pressure of a complex, live production project.

The ultimate goal is to equip you with the practical knowledge necessary to collaborate effectively and manage your own code history. By providing clear, step-by-step exercises and files explicitly designed for experimentation, this project ensures you can gain true mastery over the basic Git workflow. Use this space to make mistakes, learn from them, and firmly establish the foundational skills required before moving on to larger, team-based development projects.
### Prerequisites

To get started with this project and practice the Git commands, you primarily need two things installed on your system: Git and a Code Editor.

1. Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

    Git: The version control system itself.

    A Code Editor: To view and modify the files within the repository (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom).

    A Command Line Interface (CLI): You will be executing all Git commands through a terminal window (e.g., Terminal on Mac/Linux, Git Bash on Windows, or integrated terminal in your code editor).

2. Installation Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
